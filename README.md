# Gas_Price_Detector
Model predicting price of gas.I got the dataset from [yahoo finance page](https://finance.yahoo.com/).

# **Result**
This model was done by three Regression algorithms: Linear,Lasso, and Ridge Regression. Accuracy is:
- In Linear: 99%
- In Lasso: 95%
- In Ridge: 99%

So Lasso Regression was good but not as good as the other two algorithms.
